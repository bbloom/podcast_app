# Architecture

## Overview

A Laravel/PHP podcasting application:

- for producing and publishing 5 podcast shows. The app handles the full episode lifecycle: planning/creative, audio production, RSS feed generation, and website publishing.

- that aggregates content from YouTube channels, podcasts, and text-based RSS feeds. Content is fetched nightly, summarised using Gemini AI, and delivered to the user via configurable output destinations.

## Core Features

- **Content Sources:** YouTube channels, podcasts, text-based RSS feeds
- **Nightly Pipeline:** Fetches new content, generates AI summaries, publishes digests
- **Output Destinations:** Configurable delivery — email, SFTP webpage upload, or static site (via deploy hooks + API)
- **Lists:** Users group content sources into lists for organised digest delivery

## Database Tables

- `youtube_channels` — stores channel ID, name, last_fetched_at
- `podcasts` — stores podcast RSS URL, name, last_fetched_at (Digest feature — separate from Podcasts production module)
- `text_based_rss_feeds` — stores feed URL, name, last_fetched_at
- `lists` — user-defined groupings of content sources
- `list_sources` — polymorphic pivot joining lists to any source type
- `summaries` — AI-generated summaries, polymorphic to source type
- `output_destinations` — where digests are delivered (e.g. SFTP)
- `published_digests` — persisted digest payloads for static site output type; one record per digest run per list; served via the API to static site generators
- `language_models` — available AI models for summarisation
- `podcast_shows` — the five podcast shows; each maps to an RSS `<channel>` element; includes `intro_template` and `outro_template` columns (mandatory; used by FinalizeScriptWizard Steps 5 and 7)
- `podcast_episodes_planning` — planning/creative workspace for podcast episodes; records are hard-deleted (no soft deletes) when an episode is handed off to publishing. Includes `script_scratch` (nullable text) — ephemeral AI scratch pad for FinalizeScriptWizard Step 4; persisted to survive crashes; cleared on wizard completion (Step 9).
- `podcast_episodes_published` — published podcast episodes; each maps to an RSS `<item>` element; the API serves from this table; pipeline entry status is `ready_to_upload_recording` (set by PrepareForPublishingWizard)
- `podcast_links` — reusable links (show notes URLs, references) attached to episodes; scoped by `user_id`
- `podcast_guests` — guest profiles for interview show episodes
- `podcast_guest_episode_planning` — pivot table joining guests to planning episodes
- `podcast_guest_episode` — pivot table joining guests to published episodes
- `podcast_link_episode_planning` — pivot table joining links to planning episodes
- `podcast_link_episode` — pivot table joining links to published episodes
- `api_controls` — single-row on/off switch for the public API
- `api_clients` — authorised front-end domains and their hashed bearer tokens
- `deploy_hooks` — polymorphic table of static site deploy hook URLs; belongs to any triggerable model (PodcastShow, ListModel)
- `videos` — videos being prepared for publication to YouTube; scoped by `user_id`

## Polymorphic Relationships

Content sources (`YoutubeChannel`, `Podcast`, `TextBasedRssFeed`) are related to lists and summaries via polymorphic relationships using morph aliases.

Deploy hooks (`DeployHook`) are polymorphic via `triggerable_type` / `triggerable_id` — supporting `podcast_show` and `digest_list`.

## AI Provider Strategy

- Currently using Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`) for its generous free tier during prototyping
- The app must **not** be hard-coded to Gemini — AI providers are swappable
- A `language_models` table stores available models and providers
- Summarisation is abstracted behind a service/interface so the provider can be changed or configured per user without touching pipeline logic
- Future candidates: OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Anthropic, or others

## Digest Delivery Strategies

- Delivery logic is decoupled from digest building via the strategy pattern
- `DigestDeliveryStrategy` interface with three implementations:
  - `EmailDeliveryStrategy` — sends `DigestMailable` as the email body
  - `WebpageDeliveryStrategy` — renders Blade to HTML, uploads via SFTP
  - `StaticSiteDeliveryStrategy` — persists JSON payload to `published_digests`, fires deploy hooks
- `DeliveryStrategyResolver` maps `OutputType` enum cases to strategy classes
- `PublishDigest` job delegates to the resolved strategy — no delivery logic in the job itself
- Strategies live at `MEDIA_PLATFORM/Digest/Publishing/Strategies/`

## Digest Retention

- Each list has a retention_count field (default 10) controlling how many digest runs to keep
- DigestRetentionService::pruneForList() enforces retention after every successful delivery
- For static site lists: prunes old published_digests records (oldest beyond retention_count)
- For email and SFTP lists: prunes old summaries rows where included_in_digest = true, grouped by the date of included_in_digest_at
- Never prunes: content_already_processed (permanent bookmark), pending summaries (included_in_digest = false), or irrelevant summaries (is_relevant = false)
- Pruning is tied to the processing sequence — no separate scheduled job
- Called by PublishDigest after markAsIncluded() and before updateLastRunAt()
- See MEDIA_PLATFORM/Digest/README_RETENTION.md for full detail

## Static Site Output Type

- Third output type alongside Email and Webpage (SFTP)
- Uses a pull model: app persists data, fires deploy hooks, static site fetches via API
- `published_digests` table stores the full structured digest payload as JSON
- Each list has a `retention_count` controlling how many digest records to keep
- API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/digests` — authenticated, list identified by `X-Digest-List` header
- Deploy hooks fire automatically after digest persistence — no manual confirmation
- `PublishDigest` auto-enables the API when processing a static site list
- Notification: `StaticSiteDigestReadyNotification` — optional, confirms pipeline ran (does not contain digest content)
- See `MEDIA_PLATFORM/Digest/README_STATIC_SITE.md` for full detail

## Public API

- A stateless, read-only JSON API that serves data to Astro-based static site front-ends during their build process
- Two endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/podcastepisodes` — returns all published episodes, enabled guests, and enabled sponsors
  - `GET /api/v1/digests` — returns published digest data for static site lists, identified by `X-Digest-List` header
- The API is off by default — enabled manually via the Admin UI before an Astro build, or auto-enabled by `PublishDigest` for static site lists
- Authentication uses a bearer token plus a `RequestingDomain` header, both validated against the `api_clients` table
- Bearer tokens are stored as bcrypt hashes and shown only once at generation time
- The API on/off state is persisted in the `api_controls` database table for durability across server restarts
- `api_fetched_at` tracked on published digest records for observability
- API dashboard shows pending fetch warnings to prevent accidental disable
- Five front-end domains are registered as API clients: `bobbloomshow.com`, `bobbloominterviews.com`, `phpserverlessnews.com`, `phpserverlessprofiles.com`, `phpserverlessprojectupdates.com`
- Managed via the Admin UI at Dashboard → API Management
- See `MEDIA_PLATFORM/API/v1/README.md` for full detail

## Videos

- Lives at `MEDIA_PLATFORM/Videos/` — manages videos being prepared for publication to YouTube
- Simple CRUD with a two-step creation wizard; no create/store in CRUD (wizard only)
- `videos` table; scoped by `user_id`
- `VideoStatus` enum: `not_published_to_youtube`, `published_to_youtube`
- Session key for wizard state: `wizard.create_video.*`
- Step 2 auto-populates fields (slug, youtube_title, youtube_description, youtube_chapters, youtube_url) from Step 1 inputs — no user-facing form
- Routes named `videos.*`
- Test namespace: `Tests\Feature\MEDIA_PLATFORM\Videos\`

## Podcasts

- Lives at `MEDIA_PLATFORM/Podcasts/` — the central hub for podcast production across five shows
- The Podcasts module has its own dedicated dashboard — the main app dashboard links to it as a single entry point
- **Two-world model**: Planning (`podcast_episodes_planning`) and Published (`podcast_episodes_published`) are entirely separate tables with a hard handoff between them
- Published episodes are served via the API to Astro static site front-ends

### Digest vs Podcasts Disambiguation

The app has two separate podcast-related features that must not be confused:

- **`MEDIA_PLATFORM/Digest/ContentSources/Podcasts/`** — ingests podcast RSS feeds as content sources for the Digest feature. Routes are prefixed `/digests/podcasts/` and named `digest-podcasts.*`. Entirely separate from episode production.
- **`MEDIA_PLATFORM/Podcasts/`** — the full episode production module. Routes named `podcast_episodes.*`, `podcast_shows.*`, etc.

### Module Structure (`Podcasts/`)

- `Dashboard/` — podcast dashboard controller and routes
- `Shows/` — CRUD for podcast shows; includes `intro_template` and `outro_template` columns (mandatory; FinalizeScriptWizard enforces creation)
- `Guests/` — CRUD for podcast guests, plus attach/detach to both planning and published episodes
- `Links/` — CRUD for podcast links, plus attach/detach to both planning and published episodes; scoped by `user_id`
- `Planning/` — Planning module (see below)
- `Publishing/` — Published episode CRUD and full Post-Production pipeline
- `ArchivedEpisodes/` — `BobBloomShowArchive` for legacy archive data

### Planning Module (`Podcasts/Planning/`)

The Planning module manages the creative and assembly lifecycle of an episode before it is published.

```
Planning/
├── CRUD/
│   ├── Controllers/   — index, show, edit, update, destroy + guest/link attach/detach
│   ├── Enums/         — PodcastEpisodePlanningStatus
│   ├── Models/        — PodcastEpisodePlanning
│   ├── Requests/      — PodcastEpisodePlanningRequest
│   └── Routes/
├── CreateEpisodeWizard/     — 4 steps; creates podcast_episodes_planning record
├── EditThemeField/          — Alpine.js inline save + redirect save
├── EditScriptField/         — Alpine.js inline save + redirect save
├── FinalizeScriptWizard/    — 9 steps; locks script, sets status ready_to_record
└── PrepareForPublishingWizard/
    ├── Concerns/
    │   └── DerivesPublishedEpisodeFields.php  ← all field population methods
    └── Controllers/   — 3 steps; creates published record, migrates guests+links, hard-deletes planning record
```

**`PodcastEpisodePlanningStatus` enum cases:**
- `new_episode_created` — set by Create Episode Wizard
- `working_on_theme` — set manually
- `writing_script` — set manually
- `ready_to_finalize_the_script` — set manually; entry point for Finalize Script Wizard
- `ready_to_record` — set by Finalize Script Wizard (Step 9)
- `raw_audio_needs_editing` — set manually
- `ready_for_publishing` — set manually; entry point for Prepare for Publishing Wizard

Statuses can move backwards — the app does not enforce forward-only progression. Data is never cleared on a backwards status move.

**FinalizeScriptWizard (9 steps):**

| Step | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 1 | Introduction |
| 2 | Confirm episode number |
| 3 | Confirm title (regex rejects digit-leading titles) |
| 4 | AI Proofing — dual textarea: main script (saves to `script`) + scratch pad (saves to `script_scratch`), both Alpine.js fetch |
| 5 | Intro template review/create — updates `podcast_show.intro_template`; mandatory, no skip when absent |
| 6 | Prepend resolved intro to script |
| 7 | Outro template review/create — updates `podcast_show.outro_template`; mandatory, no skip when absent |
| 8 | Append resolved outro to script |
| 9 | Final confirmation — sets `ready_to_record`, clears `script_scratch`, forgets session |

**Hard handoff (PrepareForPublishingWizard Step 3 store):**
1. Runs all `DerivesPublishedEpisodeFields` population methods
2. Creates `podcast_episodes_published` record
3. Migrates guests from `podcast_guest_episode_planning` → `podcast_guest_episode`
4. Migrates links from `podcast_link_episode_planning` → `podcast_link_episode`
5. Hard-deletes the planning record — no soft deletes
6. Redirects to the new published episode show page

### Post-Production (`Publishing/PostProduction/`)

The RSS Pipeline Reorder is complete. The website must be published and the static site build confirmed before RSS generation begins, so that external validators see a live episode webpage and audio file.

```
PostProduction/
├── AuphonicProcessing/    Controllers/ (incl. DoneController)
├── BuildConfirmation/     Controllers/ (ShowController, ConfirmController)
├── CloudStorage/          S3 and R2 bucket/endpoint resolution classes
├── Dashboard/             DashboardController — surfaces in-progress and needs-attention episodes
├── GenerateRssFeed/       Controllers/ (Step1–3, Step4†, Step5, LiveValidationController,
│                                        RestartController, DoneController)
├── PublishOnWebsite/      Controllers/ (IndexController, ShowController, PublishController,
│                                        PrepareTriggerBuildsController, TriggerBuildsController,
│                                        TriggerBuildsResultController)
├── RegenerateRssFeed/     Controllers/ (IndexController, StageController, PromoteController,
│                                        LiveValidationController)
├── UploadProductionAudio/ Controllers/ (incl. DoneController)
├── UploadRecording/       Controllers/ (incl. DoneController)
└── Routes/
```

† `Step4Controller` is intentionally empty and deprecated — retained to explain the gap in step numbering. See its file header for full context.

**Pipeline stages (post RSS Pipeline Reorder):**

- `UploadRecording` — pre-signed S3 PUT upload, S3 file confirmation, status → `ready_for_auphonic`
- `AuphonicProcessing` — S3 file verification, Auphonic submission, webhook processing, MP3 download, clean-up; status → `ready_to_upload_production_file`
- `UploadProductionAudio` — two-path MP3 upload, getID3 metadata extraction, S3 + R2 upload; status → `ready_to_publish_website`
- `PublishOnWebsite` — sets `website_enabled = true`, status → `website_published`; stores episode ID in session, redirects to TriggerBuilds
- `TriggerBuilds` + `BuildConfirmation` — fires Cloudflare Pages deploy hooks; `BuildConfirmation` polls build status via `CloudflareBuildStatusService` using Alpine.js auto-polling; manual fallback available; status → `ready_to_generate_rss_feed`
- `GenerateRssFeed` — generates RSS XML (Steps 1–3), uploads to live S3 (Step 5, status → `ready_to_upload_rss_feed`), Live Validation page lets user validate against live S3 URL before promoting to R2; on R2 success status → `published`; validation failure sets `rss_validation_failed` (surfaced on dashboard); `RestartController` resets failed episodes back into the wizard
- `RegenerateRssFeed` — show-level maintenance flow; same S3-only-then-validate-then-R2 split as GenerateRssFeed; operates independently of any episode's pipeline status

**Done pages:** `UploadRecording`, `AuphonicProcessing`, `UploadProductionAudio`, and `GenerateRssFeed` each have a `DoneController` and done view. After completing a stage the user lands on a "Stage Complete — what next?" page with a primary "Continue to [Next Stage] →" button and a "Post-Production Dashboard" secondary link. Routes: `post_production.{stage}.done`.

**Dashboard (`Dashboard/DashboardController`):** Passes episodes in intermediate pipeline statuses (`website_published`, `build_triggered`, `ready_to_upload_rss_feed`, `rss_validation_failed`) to the view so the user can resume a stuck episode without navigating through each step's index. `postProductionShowRoute()` drives the Continue → links.

### Five Active Shows

Controllers that list shows use a `private const ACTIVE_SHOWS` array to filter and order:
1. The Bob Bloom Show
2. The Bob Bloom Interviews
3. PHP Serverless News
4. PHP Serverless Profiles
5. PHP Serverless Project Updates

### Status Enums

- `PodcastEpisodePlanningStatus` (`MEDIA_PLATFORM/Podcasts/Planning/CRUD/Enums/`): tracks the planning lifecycle — see Planning Module section above. Includes `sortOrder(): int` for pipeline-ordered dashboard sorting and `manualStatuses()` for status-change dropdowns.
- `PodcastEpisodeStatus` (`MEDIA_PLATFORM/Podcasts/Publishing/Enums/`): tracks the post-production pipeline — `ready_to_upload_recording` → `ready_for_auphonic` → `processing_at_auphonic` → `auphonic_complete` → `ready_to_upload_production_file` → `ready_to_publish_website` → `website_published` → `build_triggered` → `ready_to_generate_rss_feed` → `ready_to_upload_rss_feed` → `published`; also `rss_validation_failed` and `not_published`. `ready_to_publish` is retained for backwards compatibility with episodes that entered the pipeline before the RSS Pipeline Reorder. Includes `postProductionShowRoute(): string` — maps each status to its episode-specific pipeline route, used by the dashboard Continue buttons.
- `ready_to_upload_recording` is retained as the pipeline entry point — marked for removal once the entry point is refactored to `ready_for_publishing`.
- These two enums are deliberately separate: planning statuses apply only to planning records, production statuses apply only to published records.

## Static Site Deploy Hooks

- Lives at `MEDIA_PLATFORM/StaticSiteDeployHooks/`
- Polymorphic — a deploy hook can belong to any triggerable model (`PodcastShow`, `ListModel`)
- Morph aliases: `podcast_show` and `digest_list` — both registered in `AppServiceProvider`
- Providers supported: Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel (backed by `DeployHookProvider` enum)
- Hook URL stored encrypted — anyone holding the URL can trigger a build
- Tracks `last_triggered_at`, `last_build_id`, `last_trigger_status` per hook
- `DeployHookTriggerService` handles the HTTP POST, parses provider responses, and records outcomes including the Cloudflare deployment ID (`last_build_id`)
- `DeployHookTriggerResult` is an immutable value object carrying success/failure, build ID, HTTP status, error message
- `CloudflareBuildStatusService` polls the Cloudflare Pages REST API for deployment status using `last_build_id`; requires a scoped API token (`Account / Pages / Read`) stored in `config/podcast_post_production.php`; used by `BuildStatusController` and `BuildConfirmation`
- `CloudflareBuildStatusResult` is an immutable value object carrying API call outcome, current deployment stage/status, and convenience booleans (`isPending()`, `buildSucceeded()`, `buildFailed()`)
- `DeployHook` model provides `triggerable_display_name`, `triggerable_type_label`, and `triggerable_show_route` accessors for polymorphic view rendering
- Three trigger entry points:
  1. **Single hook** — from the deploy hook's show page (confirm → execute → result); show page also has a manual "Check Build Status" section for Cloudflare hooks
  2. **Multi-hook** — from the podcast show's show page or automatically from the post-production pipeline after publishing an episode (checkbox selection → BuildConfirmation polling)
  3. **Automatic** — `StaticSiteDeliveryStrategy` fires all enabled hooks after persisting a published digest
- Cloudflare Pages build status is checked via polling (no inbound webhook). The `BuildConfirmation` pipeline step auto-polls every 5 seconds using Alpine.js until the build succeeds or fails, then advances the episode automatically.

## Eloquent Scopes — PodcastEpisode

The following named scopes are defined on `PodcastEpisode` to avoid duplicating query logic across controllers and services:

- `scopeForUser(int $userId)` — filters by `user_id`
- `scopeWithStatus(PodcastEpisodeStatus $status)` — filters by pipeline status
- `scopeOrderByScheduledDate()` — orders by `scheduled_date` ascending
- `scopeEligibleForRssFeed(PodcastShow $show)` — `rss_feed_enabled = true` AND `itunes_pubdate < now()`, ordered by `itunes_pubdate` descending
- `scopeEligibleForPublishOnWebsite(PodcastShow $show)` — `website_enabled = true` AND `website_publish_on < now()`, ordered by `website_publish_on` descending

## Phase 2 — Additional Content Sources

- The content source architecture is designed to be extensible
- New source types can be added by creating a new feature folder, model, and implementing the shared source interface/contract
- The polymorphic `list_sources` and `summaries` tables accommodate new types without schema changes

## Nightly Pipeline (Automation Phase)

1. `FetchNewContent` job runs on scheduler
2. For each source, check RSS feed for new items since `last_fetched_at`
3. For YouTube: fetch transcript via `get_transcript.py` Python script
4. Send transcript/content to Gemini for summarisation
5. Store result in `summaries` table
6. Deliver digest via the resolved delivery strategy
7. Mark summaries as included (DigestBuilderService::markAsIncluded())
8. Prune old data based on retention policy (DigestRetentionService::pruneForList())
9. Update lists.last_run_at

## YouTube RSS Feed

- URL format: `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCxxxxxx`
- Returns up to 15 most recent videos
- Each entry contains `<yt:videoId>` directly — no URL resolving needed
- Published date is ISO 8601, parsed natively by Carbon

## Services

- `RssFeedService` — fetches and parses RSS feeds
- `SftpService` — handles SFTP connection testing and file delivery
- `DeployHookTriggerService` — fires deploy hook URLs and records outcomes
- `CloudflareBuildStatusService` — polls the Cloudflare Pages API for deployment status; requires scoped API token in `config/podcast_post_production.php`
- `DigestApiService` — queries published digests for the API endpoint
- `DeliveryStrategyResolver` — resolves delivery strategy by OutputType
- `DigestRetentionService` — prunes old digest data based on per-list retention_count

## RAG / Vector Search (Proof of Concept)

- pgvector extension on PostgreSQL
- Embeddings generated via external API
- Stored in `article_chunks` table with a `vector` column
- Cosine similarity search for semantic retrieval
